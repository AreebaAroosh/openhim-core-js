Health Worker Electronic Response and Outreach – is one way to harness the well-known power of mobile technology to reach frontline health workers. mHero, currently under rapid development with support from a consortium of partners including the UNICEF Global Centre for Innovations, USAID, IntraHealth, ThoughtWorks, and Jembi Health Systems is a free SMS mobile phone based communications system between MoH staff, health workers, and community health workers. By supporting the interoperability of HRIS systems, such as IntraHealth’s iHRIS, with UNICEF’s RapidPRO, and utilizing the OpenHIE architecture, the platform can immediately use the health workforce data to target specific communications based on cadre, location, and other information. Communications, which can be triggered both centrally and locally, go far beyond traditional “message blasts” offered by many technology vendors. Real-time monitoring, complex multi-path surveys, monitoring and detailed analysis can be conducted with ease. Furthermore, IVR mLearning approaches will take knowledge delivery one-step beyond SMS with higher content limits and addressing the literacy and language divides through spoken language.

## Why the OpenHIM for mHero?

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
